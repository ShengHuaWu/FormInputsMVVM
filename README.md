## Form Inputs in MVVM
According to [Swift Talk episode 53](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E53-test-driven-reactive-programming-at-kickstarter), Lisa and Chris demonstrated a way to deal with form inputs with Functional Reactive Programming.
This project is a simpler version of handling form inputs without any FRP library, and I adopt the view model implementation in [Swift Talk episode 47](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E47-view-models-at-kickstarter).
